# Trivia Project
This project was developed while a student at Trybe.

## What does the application do?
  - On the home screen, the user puts his name and email to start playing;
 
  - If the email is registered in Gravatar, the profile picture is imported from there;

  - At the moment, the user answers 5 questions, with a timer of 30 seconds for each;

  - After the 5 questions the user is forwarded to a results screen;

  - On the results screen, the user decides if he wants to play again or see the Ranking page;

  - The Settings screen is still under development.

- Redux;
- React-Router.
